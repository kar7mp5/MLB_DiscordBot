# Contributing Guidelines

Your input is amazing! Making contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible is one of the most important side, this includes:

-   Reporting a bug
-   Discussing the current state of the code
-   Submitting a fix
-   Proposing new features
-   Becoming a maintainer

## Wanted changes

-   New features
-   Better documentation
-   Fixing of spelling and grammatical issues

## Unwanted changes

-   Whitespaces and punctuation changes
-   Word changes using synonyms
-   Entire rewrites of the project, or parts of the project - unless approved first by a maintainer

## Commit messages guidelines

This project uses [`Conventional Commits 1.0.0`](https://conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) hence your commit messages **must** follow the same convention or your contributions will be ignored, refused or assigned to another user or maintainer.

It would be more than welcome to keep your contributions as a single commit rather than, for examples, 20 `"fix: Stuff"` commits in-between. You may use multiple commmits if you believe the changes made in these commmits have nothing, or close to nothing, in common - feel free to ask a maintainer on whether or not it should be a single commit or not.

## Create a GitHub [Issue](https://github.com/5th-Industrial-Revolution-Club/MLB_DiscordBot/issues) and **then** a pull request

Start contributing by first [opening a new issue](https://github.com/5th-Industrial-Revolution-Club/MLB_DiscordBot/issues/new). Once that is done, you can create a pull request for the issue.

## License

Your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/blob/main/LICENSE.md) that covers the project.
